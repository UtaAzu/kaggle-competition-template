# Repository Structure and Conventions

- src/: Reusable library code (dataset, model, training loop, metrics, augmentations).
- scripts/: Shell and batch scripts to glue steps together.
  - Keep one-off CLIs either here under scripts/tools/ or move to src/cli/ (avoid both).
- config/: Configuration files (YAML/Hydra). One config per experiment or component.
- experiments/: One directory per experiment.
  - {ID}/
    - README.md: Goal, setup, decisions, results.
    - run.json: Machine-readable metadata (id, title, date, commit, config, metric, notes).
    - notebooks/: Experiment-specific notebooks.
    - artifacts/: Outputs produced by the run (predictions, checkpoints if small, plots).
- notebooks/: Non-experiment exploratory notebooks only. Prefer experiments/{ID}/notebooks/.
- artifacts/: Team-wide shared outputs if needed. Prefer experiment-local artifacts to avoid confusion.
- train.py, predict.py: Entrypoints. They should consume config/ and src/ only.

## Experiment naming
- ID: EXP### (padded 3 digits) + short slug, e.g., EXP012_roberta_base_mixup
- Create from the template under experiments/_template/

## Index
- Do not edit experiments/INDEX.md by hand. It's auto-generated by scripts/update_experiment_index.py.
